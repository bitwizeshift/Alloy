This development kit is licensed under the [MIT License](../LICENSE),
which is an open-source initiative approved license.

Under this license, you may use **Alloy** for any purpose you wish
_WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY_, and modify it as you see fit -- subject to the one
condition:

> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
> all copies or substantial portions of the software

## Simplified

In non legal terms, this means that whenever an application built with **Alloy** is
distributed -- either as source code, or as a binary package, the
[license text](../LICENSE) must also accompany the distribution in some form.
This may be in the form of a printed documentation, a digital list of
credits distributed with the application, or even as acknowledgement
from within the application itself (e.g. in credits, 'about', etc).

Similarly, if the the **Alloy** project is used as the basis to a new engine,
attribution must be made for any substantially copied portions (algorithms,
designs, etc.).

## Endorsement

At no point is **Alloy** or any of its contributors to be misrepresented as
endorsing a project that uses this engine without prior written
acknowledgement from the maintainers.
