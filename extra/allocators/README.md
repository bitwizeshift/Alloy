# Extra: `Alloy::Extra::Allocators`

**Alloy** bundles the target `Alloy::Extra::Allocators` as a
supplementary/optional component to allow for more fine-grained support of
memory management within the system.

This provides different allocation strategies through a series of
memory-resources, as well as providing debugging utilities to ensure that
memory issues do not occur at runtime.
